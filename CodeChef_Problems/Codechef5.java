/*Chef's son Chefu found some matches in the kitchen and he immediately starting playing with them.
The first thing Chefu wanted to do was to calculate the result of his homework â€” the sum of A and 
B, and write it using matches. Help Chefu and tell him the number of matches needed to write the result. */
